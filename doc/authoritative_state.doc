/** \page authoritative_state Authoritative State
 *
 *  TODO: Authoritative State.
 *   - Most state is pertinent only to objects and maintained by objects (within
 *  the object host, most likely by the object script itself).
 *   - Some should be maintained on a per-object basis by the object host in
 *  order to provide additional services (e.g. mesh URLs to automatically
 *  maintain mesh, physics bounding mesh, bounding region, and communicate those
 *  to the space automatically).
 *   - And finally, some *must* be maintained by the space because it is
 *  critical that it be consistently seen by all participants and because it
 *  affects interactions between objects at the lowest level.  Examples include
 *  object locations and bounding regions.
