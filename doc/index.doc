/** \page index Introduction
 *
 *  <h2> Introduction </h2>
 *  Sirikata is an BSD licensed open source platform for games and virtual
 *  worlds. We aim to provide a set of libraries and protocols which can be
 *  used to deploy a virtual world, as well as fully featured sample
 *  implementations of services for hosting and deploying these worlds.
 *
 *  Sirikata is not an application but a platform on which shared, networked,
 *  3D applications can be built.  Examples include multiplayer online games,
 *  interactive meeting spaces, and social virtual worlds.  Sirikata
 *  recognizes that large parts of these systems are identical -- objects
 *  join a shared space, discover other objects, communicate with each other,
 *  have behavior defined by small scripts, and so on -- and attempts to
 *  provide scalable, flexible, and extensible implementations of these
 *  services.  Application developers can build on Sirikata's infrastructure,
 *  taking advantage of a much lower barrier to entry and proven scalability.
 *
 *  <h2> Target Audience </h2>
 *  This manual is targeted at <b>users</b> of Sirikata.  Note that this means
 *  users of the platform, not users of applications built on Sirikata.  So
 *  in this case, user means an application developer.  Because Sirikata has
 *  many standard components with reasonable defaults, ideally applications
 *  can be developed mainly in scripting languages.  However, this manual is
 *  geared towards users who need to also extend Sirikata, adding
 *  functionality which is not already available from the existing plugins.
 *

 *  appropriate for your release, before proceeding.
